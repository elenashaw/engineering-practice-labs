# Multidisciplinary Engineering & CS Labs 🛠️

This repository serves as a structured archive of my foundational projects and technical implementations across several engineering disciplines. It documents my journey in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application.

> **Note:** These projects are primarily developed as part of my academic curriculum and independent study to master core principles through hands-on practice.
